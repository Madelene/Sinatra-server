# Sinatra-server
==================

#Wyncode week 4 - created a Sinatra server
* Require 'sinatra' in the server.rb file
* Create a Gemfile, which specifies the ruby version and the source that downloads the gems ("https://rubygems.org")
* Bundle install (or simply "bundle") in the terminal to create a Gemfile.lock file (that we should never edit!). Confirm that the Gemfile is correct with this file.
* Create a Procfile to tell Heroku how to run various pieces of the app.
* Create a public folder to put the .txt file (available online).
