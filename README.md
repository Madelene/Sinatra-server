# Sinatra-server
==================

#Wyncode week 4 - created a server using Sinatra
* We needed to require 'sinatra' in the server.rb file
* Created a Gemfile, which specifies the ruby version and the source that downloads the gems ("https://rubygems.org")
* Bundle install (or simply "bundle") in the terminal will create a Gemfile.lock file (that we should never edit!). This confirms that the Gemfile is correct.
* Then, we created a Procfile. The Procfile is created to tell Heroku how to run various pieces of the app.
* A public folder was created after that, and this is where we put our .txt file (available online).
